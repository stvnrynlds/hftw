dang, it's 2006. well, since the fans (nick and chrissy) want me to update the site, here you two go. [note that i use the term 'fan' very loosely]. i'm working on a new simple style, and checking out different programs so it's not just lame bitmapness. so, for now, i give you a sketch in photoshop elements and a preview of what's to come... i guess. don't get your hopes up. <br><br>

  howdy howdy howdy. i've finally gotten a real, live, functional guestbook up 
  and running. don't mind my random test post; go ahead and drop me a note if 
  you feel so compelled. i would ask you to leave donations as well, but a way 
  of donating is pretty nonexistant, and this webhost is free. never ever ever 
  <i>ever </i>send me donations, no matter how hard i beg. but if i'm not begging, 
  i don't mind at all. anyone who reads this, freewebspace.com is pretty much 
  the coolest free webhost in the universe. sign up for their service. be a man.<br>
  <br>
  new portrait. don't know what it is with me and drawing people's faces... one 
  of these days they'll look realistic. <br>
  until that day, i give you these types: <br>

  i apologize for the long wait... i really am working on the page. i've been

  never studied this much for anything else, and i'm trying to make the site as

  cooler than this one... i'll have screen shots up soon... but you can see the

  sorry, no more pictures today. i have been working really hard on getting the 
  new design done (still a while to go), and found some useful information on 
  <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2001/03/23/rollovers.html" target="_parent"><br>
  using CSS for mouseover effects</a> instead of javascript. it's so easy, and 
  i could have figured it out if i really tried. oh well, it's nice having someone 
  else find it out for you. so yeah, you can <a href="../revamp/pixel_idea.png">click 
  here</a> to see some more stuff i've done... it's basically an update of the 
  previous image i posted. it looks really cool in my mind... just getting it 
  onto the wizzywhig! (heh, i know that's not how you say it... it just sounds 
  cool) also, i found out why my HTML wasn't validatable... because of the counter 
  on my site... it puts javasscript coding outside of the &lt;HTML&gt;...&lt;/HTML&gt; 
  tag, and the validator doesn't like that... so i'll have to think of some other 
  way to do that. my CSS verified though *proud*, and besides the little JS anomaly 
  my HTML is validatable... <br>

  explain all of this in the FAQs section. that's what it's there for. also, <i> 
  happy new year everybody!</i> and some people were wondering whether i did this 
  design myself or if i used a template; to clear everything up, i made this all
