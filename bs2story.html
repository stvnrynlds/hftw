  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steam rose from 
  the coffee-filled cup held by Science Technician Michael Reese Roper, as he 
  slowly stirred its contents and breathed in its comforting warmth. Charts, drawings, 
  pages with incomprehensible data covered his already-crowded desk, sparing just 
  enough room for his computer, a lamp, and a blue pen that sat delicately balancing 
  on the desk's edge. He noted the time on his watch; midnight had come and gone. 
  All through the third floor of the NASA space and technology building, dim fluorescent 
  lights lit the narrow hallways that wound tediously through the building, and 
  only the bustling of the late-night janitor could be heard echoing down the 
  halls. The flickering of the computer screen caught his gaze for a few minutes, 
  then, slowly regaining consciousness, he rose, grabbing his jacket and car keys 
  from the office floor. He exited the room, locking the door behind him, leaving 
  the untouched coffee on his desk. Anxieties harassed his already preoccupied 
  mind as he wandered out of the Science and Technology building, through the 
  parking lot to his car. It's going to be one heck of a week, he thought as he 
  started his car and drove off, the exhaust leaving a trail of cooled steam as 
  he slowly slipped from view, plagued by his worries and his doubts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gentlemen.&quot; 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inviting voice 
  and an open hand welcomed four men into the mission control head's office. Introductions 
  were exchanged, and each person found their respective seats. The mission control 
  head, known by all as Mr. Schull, and only by a few as James, sank into his 
  seat at his desk, facing his visitors. His visitors, however, positioned in 
  four consecutive fabric chairs that lined the wall, were not without their own 
  acclaim. Before Mr. James T. Schull sat the crew of the Saturn V space shuttle, 
  due for takeoff in the first manned orbit of the planet Saturn. The first man, 
  an eager science professor in his early thirties with the name of Michael Reese 
  Roper, was also the proposed Science Technician for the mission's onboard experiments 
  of the planet's atmosphere and chemical makeup. The second, Payload Specialist 
  Dennis Bayne Culp, also in his early thirties, added a lanky component to the 
  otherwise stocky group. The third and scruffy looking one of the group, Shuttle 
  Technician Andrew &quot;Chaka&quot; Verdecchio, sat in his bleak gray jumpsuit 
  lined with a myriad of tools and grease stains, his glasses off-center, and 
  his hair untouched from his waking earlier that morning. In the fourth seat 
  sat the Mission Commander, Keith Hoerig, his jet-black hair and somewhat rebellious 
  eyebrow piercing revealed a small part of his wild past, although his ability 
  to take control of chaotic situations proved him fit for his job. This team, 
  hand picked and trained from January to mid-April, were appointed to live onboard 
  a space shuttle for a three year flight to the planet Saturn, a never-before 
  attempted mission because of its high risks. In spite of the seemingly inevitable 
  failure of this mission, they gladly accepted the invitation. In just six short 
  days, the crew would be launching from their planet into the frigid deep of 
  space.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am proud 
  to have such fine men in my own office,&quot; continued Mr. Schull, with an 
  air of remembrance about him.&quot;Through the years many other great men have 
  sat in the very chairs you are sitting in. Great men like Neil Armstrong, Alan 
  Shepard, and Lou Colins [get names]. Do you know what made these men great? 
  Courage.&quot; <br>
  He paused, then paced to one wall, his brow very furrowed. &quot;Courage, determination, 
  and willpower. Without these three points, we would not be looking at these 
  men today as being 'great'. And we have chosen you for your strength in these 
  points. We believe you will surpass the feats of those past, and raise the bar 
  of space exploration to a new level.&quot; The age old Mission Control Head 
  James T. Schull, or &quot;Chief&quot;, as they called him, waved a pen about 
  in his hands as he spoke, gesturing with each inflected syllable, and subconsciously 
  reveling at his profound speech. Reese Roper glanced at his watch, then back 
  up at the verbose Chief. Sleep was not a state that Mr. Roper fell easily into 
  as of late, and you could tell it just by looking at him. His hair was messy, 
  his eyes, tired and baggy, and he couldn't help but slouch in the chair that 
  had held so many prominent figures in American history. A yawn escaped from 
  his lungs, but his hand quickly hid it. Before he realized it was over, the 
  Chief's speech ended, and his distant mind rocketed back to reality just in 
  time to catch the last few words: &quot;Hope, gentlemen. It is your friend, 
  and it will be your savior. Hold on to it. Always hope.&quot; Hope. He was too 
  tired to think about hope. Home. That was more like it. He drove back to his 
  house that wet, gray afternoon with the Chief's words still echoing in his head, 
  though he couldn't understand at this point how true they actually were.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roughly 
  five and one half inches from Michael Reese Roper's ear, his accursed telephone 
  burst to life. Covers were thrown back and things that should never be repeated 
  were muttered as Reese tried to discern between what was reality and what was 
  in his mind. Slowly, he became conscious of the phone waiting patiently beside 
  him, and reached to answer it. He brought the receiver to his ear and listened. 
  After a few seconds, he was snapped back into reality, and shot his wrist in 
  front of his eyes to check the time. His watch blinked &quot;1:12 p.m., 1:12 
  p.m., 1:12 p.m.&quot;. Through the phone, he listened in disbelief as news reached 
  his ears, its sudden impact bringing a feeling similar to one's heart being 
  stabbed through with a dull knife. He hung up and cried.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keith 
  Hoerig of the Saturn V mission stood in front of the mirror, fixing his hair, 
  clothes, and adjusting his piercing. It was Saturday, and all that stood between 
  him and a launch into the solitary confinement of space was two, very short, 
  hours. He sighed. It was too short. He looked down at his bathroom sink. Staring 
  up at him was a picture of his fianc&eacute;, Eryn, and himself, at her birthday 
  dinner. He sighed once more. This whole space thing was going to be a lot harder 
  than he thought. Removing the picture from the sink, he tucked it in his inner 
  coat pocket, patted it, then walked out of the bathroom, out of his house, into 
  the warmed-up car waiting in his drive. He rested his forehead against the steering 
  wheel and cried.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dude!&quot; 
  A shout broke through Dennis Culp's concentration of his current focus, reading 
  the morning's comics, and brought his head up from its lowered position. Andrew 
  Verdecchio bounded into his living room, scooped up Dennis' son Copeland, lifted 
  him into the air, and proceeded to twirl them around with loud, spittle-enhanced 
  rocket sounds. Landing him on the floor, he walked into the adjoining kitchen 
  and gave Dennis a hug.<br>
  &quot;Whoa there, buddy,&quot; Dennis chided, &quot;we're going to be in the 
  same ship for three years. I don't want to get too used to you.&quot;<br>
  Chaka laughed, gave him a pat on the back and asked, &quot;You all packed? The 
  car's revved and ready to head down to the launch pad, and I've already got 
  all my stuff in it.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Yeah, got it right here,&quot; he answered, patting a large suitcase and 
  duffel bag sitting on the table next to him. &quot;Let me say goodbye to everyone 
  first, and I'll meet you outside.&quot;<br>
  Chaka ran out back to his car, waving goodbye to Copeland as he passed, while 
  Dennis walked into the living room to hug his wife and kid. Copeland jumped 
  on his leg, wrestling him down with big gasps of laughter. Dennis laughed, pulled 
  him off, and looked up to see his wife, Melinda, looking back at him. Slowly, 
  he got up, hugged and kissed his wife goodbye, whispered I love yous in her 
  ear, and walked out of the house, the door closing itself behind him. As the 
  car zoomed off, Copeland waved goodbye from the large window in the front of 
  the house. Melinda turned and cried.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
  half-hour drive to the launch pad from Keith's home was a long one. His fianc&eacute; 
  was studying in England, and he felt a large gap in his heart. It was April 
  27th, 2003, and she was scheduled to return in exactly one month. It wouldn't 
  matter. He would be gone for a three-year mission, and wouldn't be able to see 
  her when she came back, or for three years after, for that matter. He fought 
  back his tears and focused his thoughts on the event that was about to take 
  place in just a short while. Closing his eyes, he prayed. He prayed for Eryn, 
  for the crew, and lastly for himself. As the NASA Space center came into view, 
  he repeated his petitions again. A tingling sensation came over his body as 
  he thought about what this cold, gray day held. Later today, he would be in 
  space. <i>In space&#133; </i>His mind wandered for a bit, but he shook it off 
  before he pulled into the security checkpoint.<br>
  &quot;Name and I.D., please.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Keith Hoerig, 122989&quot;<br>
  &quot;Proceed.&quot;<br>
  He followed the guard's gesture towards the parking lot, pulling his olive-green 
  Jeep Wrangler into the parking spot bearing his name. It was only a short walk 
  to the main control station, but just long enough for Keith to soak in the humid 
  air and feel the slight tingling of the breeze as it passed over his skin. It 
  started today.</font></p>
